                    in the late 1980's Microsoft hailed a new technology as what 
                    they called &quot;The new papyrus&quot; to be the future of 
                    computing, but CDROM was much slower getting out of the blocks 
                    than anticipated. In fact, most new PC technologies have followed 
                    this pattern. </font></p>

                    its almost impossible to buy a new computer without CDROM

                    businesses are using basically the same generic programs they 
                    used 10 years ago - but on a different class of PC - with 
                    a new look, and with a supposed new user friendliness. </font></p>

                    in 20 years, many wonder how far have we really come, and 
                    what has really changed. </font></p>
